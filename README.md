# Typing Speed Test

This is a simple typing speed test application built using Python's Tkinter library. It allows users to test their typing speed within a specified time limit.

## Features

- Random words are displayed, and users need to type them accurately within the given time.
- The application calculates typing speed (words per minute) based on the number of correctly typed words.
- It also tracks the number of correct hits and missed words.
- Users can see their score and remaining time during the test.

## How to Use

1. Run the Python script `typing_speed_test.py`.
2. Start typing the displayed word in the entry field.
3. Hit the Enter key after typing each word.
4. The timer starts counting down from 60 seconds.
5. The test ends when the time runs out, and a summary of the performance is displayed.
